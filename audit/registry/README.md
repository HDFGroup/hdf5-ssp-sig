# Registries

This directory contains the registry of safety hazards, security threats, and privacy exposures for HDF5.
Each item is documented in a separate markdown file:

- `safety-hazards.md` — safety hazards that can cause physical harm or damage.
- `security-threats.md` — security threats that can cause unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption.
- `privacy-exposures.md` — privacy exposures that can lead to personally identifiable information (PII) leaks or non-compliance with privacy regulations.

Each registry entry includes a description of the hazard/threat/exposure, its severity and likelihood.

The file `HDF5_CWE_TOP_X.md` contains a mapping of HDF5 issues to relevant [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html) software weaknesses, providing a standardized taxonomy for understanding and addressing common vulnerabilities in the HDF5 ecosystem.

The file `asset-register.md` contains an inventory of critical assets in the HDF5 ecosystem, including software components, data types, and user groups, along with their associated risk profiles and mitigation strategies.

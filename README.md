# HDF Ecosystem Safety, Security & Privacy (SSP) Special Interest Group
 
This repository hosts the governance, processes, and artifacts of the HDF Ecosystem Safety, Security, and Privacy (SSP) Special Interest Group (SIG).
 
The SSP SIG exists to:
 
- Improve the safety, security, and privacy posture of all projects within The HDF Group ecosystem. While our primary focus is the core HDF5 library and file format, our scope explicitly encompasses HSDS, official tools, language bindings, and other related projects.
- Coordinate community expertise around threat modeling, audits, incident readiness, and secure operational practices across these projects.
- Provide practical guidance, checklists, and tooling for users and implementers across the broader HDF ecosystem.
 
## Getting Involved
 
We welcome participation from:
 
- Contributors and maintainers of HDF5 and all related HDF Group projects (including HSDS, viewer tools, API bindings, and ecosystem plugins).
- Organizations that deploy HDF5 or other HDF technologies in production (research, HPC, industry, cloud).
- Security, privacy, and reliability practitioners with relevant expertise.
 
### Ways to contribute
 
- Propose work via a **Proposal issue** (use the "SSP Proposal" template).
- Join SSP SIG meetings and help review proposals and decisions.
- Help author and review guidance, checklists, and reference configs for HDF projects.
- Participate in audits and tabletop exercises.

Links to recurring meeting invites, video calls, and notes will be added here once established.
